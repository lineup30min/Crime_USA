    "text": "1.1 Motivation\nMy partner and I are new to New York. Moving from San Diego, top desirable place according to US News, to New York, my personal experience and observations spark an interest in exploring crime patterns in the United States. The catalyst for this exploration is a poignant event happened several blocks away form my apartment–a shooting incident in October–even though nobody was shot. Additionally, as members of the Columbia Community, my partner and I receive Clery Alerts by email several times, providing an awareness of potential concerns.\nRecognizing that emotions might speak louder than fact, we are interested in understanding the number of arrests by crimes between adults and juvenile in the nation, the common identity of criminals, and discovering the motivations that constitutes crimes. We aim to analyze and discern the pattern to mitigate risks in the future. Also, we want to gain more empirical insights into the safety of New York compared to other parts of the country from the datasets.\nFor this EDAV final project, we choose to focus on three datasets obtained from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) website: hate crime, number of adult arrests by crime, and number of juvenile arrests by crime. We will introduce data information in the following Data section."

    "text": "1.2 For readers who are not familiar with Hate Crime\nFrom U.S. Department of Justice, Hate Crime is “at the federal level, a crime motivated by bias against race, color, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability.” Rather than emphasis on “the feeling of hate”, it shows the bias towards certain groups with specific characteristics.\nHate Crime is considered as crime because it contains physical or verbal harms. For example, a person says “I hate transgenders, why do they dress like that?” and begins shouting threats is a type of Hate Crime."

    "section": "2.1 Technical description",
    "text": "2.1 Technical description\nIn our project, we leverage data sourced from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Crime Data Explorer (accessible at https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/downloads), curated by Xinran She. Our focus is on analyzing the causes of arrests categorized by crime, with an emphasis on distinguishing between adult and juvenile arrests. To this end, we utilize three datasets: “Reported Number of Adult Arrests by Crime,” “Reported Number of Juvenile Arrests by Crime,” and “Hate Crime 2022”. These records are reliable because only data from agencies that provided arrest records for 12 months of the year can be included. Meanwhile, they are in CSV format, which can be directly imported and read in R, offering ease of access and compatibility for our subsequent data visualization efforts.\n\n2.1.1 Reported Number of Adult Arrests by Crime\nThis dataset comprises data on the monthly count of adult arrests for a range of offenses, as reported by cooperating law enforcement agencies, spanning 1995 to 2016. The file was last modified in 2017 and is now completed. The dataset includes 644 rows and 47 columns. Each row of the data represents an offense reason based on a specific year, and the columns decompose the count of the arrested adults by age, race, and sex. The age range of offenders covered by this form is 18-65 years old. From the website, agencies might not provide race information, but age and sex should be clearly reported. So, some of the missing gender information may affect the subsequent visualization and analysis.\n\n\n2.1.2 Reported Number of Juvenile Arrests by Crime\nSimilar to 2.1-1, this dataset records the monthly count of juvenile arrests for different offenses, as reported by participating law enforcement agencies from 1995 to 2016. The file was last modified in 2017 and is now completed. The dataset includes 690 rows and 27 columns. Each row of the data represents an offense reason based on a specific year, and the columns decompose the count of the arrested adults by age, race, and sex. The age range of offenders covered by this form is 9-17 years old. The potential problem with the data is the same as 2.1-1 due to the insufficiency of race information.\n\n\n2.1.3 Hate Crime 2022\nThe hate crime dataset compiles annual data from 1991 to 2022, last updated in 2023, encompassing details on incidents, offenses, and involved individuals - both victims and offenders - in crimes driven by the perpetrator’s bias towards the victim’s race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. Due to the extensive size of the original file, our analysis is concentrated on the data from 2022. This dataset segment contains 11,643 rows and 28 columns, each representing an individual incident and providing comprehensive incident details, including geographical location, numbers of victims and offenders, and the nature of the bias involved. A challenge presented by this dataset is its considerable size and the abundance of categorical data it contains. To effectively glean insights, engaging in data manipulation, compiling, and analyzing aggregate information is necessary."

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\nBased on the previous questions we proposed in introduction part, we’ve structured our investigation into three key stages: imputing missing values, manipulating and aggregating data, and conducting visualization and analysis.\nRegarding our first research question, we plan to explore the relationship between identity factors like age, gender, or race, and crime arrests among juveniles and adults. To effectively depict these associations, we’ll employ various graphical representations. These will include basic bar charts for straightforward comparisons, stacked bars to illustrate the combined effects of multiple factors, and scatter plots to examine correlations or similarities between the two demographic groups. Meanwhile, we plan to use mosaic plots to visually represent data encompassing two or more qualitative variables, which is particularly effective for illustrating the relationships. For the second question, which seeks to identify the most prevalent motivations behind crimes, our approach will involve the use of simple bar charts. These charts will display the relative frequency of different offense types, offering a clear view of the most common factors leading to criminal activity.\nFor the third research question, focusing on the trends in arrest populations and the relationship within socio-economic factors. Line graphs will be our primary tool to depict the trends in arrest numbers over various years, with years plotted on the x-axis and arrest counts on the y-axis. To analyze the interplay between multiple socio-economic factors alongside these trends, we will use multi-line charts. These charts will simultaneously display how each socio-economic variable changes over the same period, allowing for a comprehensive comparison and correlation analysis.\nSimilarly for the fourth question, focusing on the highest hate crime state and with some specific bias type, we will utilize pie charts to effectively illustrate the proportion of each bias type. Additionally, for a more granular analysis of categories like location types, offender races, and bias types, treemaps will be employed as they offer a concise visual summary. For instance, in a treemap, each major section could represent a distinct bias type, further divided into sub-sections based on offender race or location type. This approach provides an intuitive and detailed view of the hate crime data, highlighting key patterns and distributions."

    "section": "2.3 Missing value analysis",
    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\n\n2.3.1 First load our dataset:\n\n\nCode\narrest_juvenile = read.csv(\"preprocessing/arrests_national_juvenile.csv\")\narrest_adults = read.csv(\"preprocessing/arrests_national_adults.csv\")\nhate_crime22 = read.csv(\"preprocessing/hate_crime_2022.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Use aggregated missing patterns to check missing values in each dataset:\nArrest_juvenile\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(redav)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nplot_missing(arrest_juvenile, percent = FALSE)+\n  theme_bw(5)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe column “state_abbr” (state abbreviation)is completely absent. Unfortunately, we couldn’t find other datasets which perfectly make up for the lack of state abbreviation. Since our main goal is not about discovering arrest crimes in specific states, we decide to drop “state_abbr” column. We have several missing values in “american_indian” and “asian_pacific_islander”, which are more likely to be missing due to “not all agencies report race and/or ethnicity for arrests” from the FBI. We also have missing values in “f_0_9”, f_0_12”, “m_0_9”, “f_13_14”, “f_15”, “m_10_12”, “f_16” in decreasing order. Even though “all agencies must report age and sex”, it is hard to implement in reality. By intuition, these omissions might stem from the actual absence of instances, given that the corresponding class values are zero. For example, in 2016, there is a missing value for males aged between 0 to 9 arrested for Embezzlement. Given the unlikely occurrence of embezzlement by children under 10, it is reasonable to impute it as 0. Since missing values are not correlated with other variables and take up only a small percent, we would impute 0 for the missing values in those columns.\nArrest_adults\n\n\nCode\nplot_missing(arrest_adults, percent = FALSE)+\n  theme_bw(5)\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the column “state_abbr” (state abbreviation)is entirely missing. This time, we have fewer columns with missing values, only “f_60_64”, f_65_p”, “f_55_59” in decreasing order. In other words, we can see missing values are concentrated in females aged between 55 to 65+. The interesting pattern might caused by certain oversight when reporting elderly women in the agencies. Or, it may be attributed to the likelihood that women aged above 55 are hardly prone to crimes, which is reasonable for us to interpret the corresponding class values as 0. Since missing values are not correlated with other variables and take up only a small percent, we would impute 0 for the missing values in those columns.\nHate Crime\n\n\nCode\nplot_missing(hate_crime22, percent = FALSE)+\n  theme_bw(5)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have equal number of missing values in “adult_offender_count” and “juvenile_offender_count”. They are correlated because in each hate crime incident, agencies either report all the offenders, or they fail to report. The number of missing value of “juvenile_victim_count” is slightly higher than “adult_victim_count”. One of the possible explanation is that the agencies are more likely to protect the privacy of juvenile that they choose not to report in the reality. We also have missing values in “total_individual_victims”, given “total_individual_victims” is likely correlated with “juvenile_victim_count” and “adult_victim_count”. Since for Hate Crime, we are more interested in the “location, offender race and bias type” instead of the number of offenders and victims, we could subset the dataset to drop the columns with missing values.\n\n\n2.3.3 Missing value imputation and column drop\n\n\nCode\n# drop column\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\narrest_juvenile &lt;- select(arrest_juvenile, -state_abbr)\n# imputation the missing value\narrest_juvenile[is.na(arrest_juvenile)] &lt;- 0\n\n\n\n\nCode\narrest_adults &lt;- select(arrest_adults, -state_abbr)\n# imputation the missing value\narrest_adults[is.na(arrest_adults)] &lt;- 0\n\n\n\n\nCode\nhate_crime22 &lt;- select(hate_crime22, select = -c(\"adult_offender_count\", \"juvenile_offender_count\", \"juvenile_victim_count\",\n                                                 \"adult_victim_count\", \"total_individual_victims\"))\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Check NA value\n\n\nCode\narrest_juvenile_null = sum(is.na(arrest_juvenile))\nprint(paste(\"NA value in arrest_juvenile: \", arrest_juvenile_null))\n\n\n[1] \"NA value in arrest_juvenile:  0\"\n\n\nCode\narrest_adults_null = sum(is.na(arrest_adults))\nprint(paste(\"NA value in arrest_adults: \", arrest_adults_null))\n\n\n[1] \"NA value in arrest_adults:  0\"\n\n\nCode\nhate_crime_null = sum(is.na(hate_crime22))\nprint(paste(\"NA value in hate_crime22: \", hate_crime_null))\n\n\n[1] \"NA value in hate_crime22:  0\""

vcd::spacing_equal(sp = unit(0.2, \"lines\")),\n  main = \"Association between Age, Gender, and Grouped Year in Adults Arrests\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make the graph more clearly, we grouped every 5 or 6 years, also grouping the age according to Age Categories (https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/concepts/definitions/age2).\nThe first mosaic plot shows the distribution of arrests broken down by gender and age group over different year groups in juvenile. The larger blocks suggest a higher number of arrests. The most noticeable pattern is that male arrests overwhelmingly outnumber female arrests across all age groups. As juveniles grow older, they are more likely to be involved in crime and get arrest–arrests are mostly concentrated in the 15-17 age group. Another pattern is that arrests generally decrease in 2011-2016 year group, compared to 1994-1999 year_group. We might conclude that early education has garnered particular attention in recent year.\nSimilar to the juvenile arrests, male arrests are more prevalent than female. Younger adults (especially those aged 18-29) are more likely to be arrested than older adults, indicating a strong association between age and arrest for adults. Female over 60 years old hardly get arrest. From both plots, the most important level of dependent variable is age."

    "text": "3.3 Common Motivations Behind Crimes in the United States\n\n3.3.1 Logarithmic Arrest by Offense Name\n\n\nCode\narrest_juvenile &lt;- arrest_juvenile %&gt;%\n  group_by(offense_name) %&gt;%\n  mutate(median_log_total_arrest = median(log_total_arrest)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(offense_name = reorder(offense_name, median_log_total_arrest))\n\narrest_adults &lt;- arrest_adults %&gt;%\n  group_by(offense_name) %&gt;%\n  mutate(median_log_total_arrest = median(log_total_arrest)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(offense_name = reorder(offense_name, median_log_total_arrest))\n\n\nggplot(arrest_juvenile, aes(y = offense_name, x = log_total_arrest)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Juvenile Arrest Count by Offense Name\", x = \"Offense Name\", y = \"Case Count (log scaled)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") # Adjust legend position as needed\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(arrest_adults, aes(y = offense_name, x = log_total_arrest)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(title = \"Adult Arrest Count by Offense Name\", x = \"Offense Name\", y = \"Case Count (log scaled)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") # Adjust legend position as needed\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addressing the question about predominant motivations for crimes in the United States, we conducted an in-depth analysis using boxplots to examine the frequency of various offenses committed by both juveniles and adults. To account for the wide variance in the raw number of cases, we applied logarithmic scaling to the case counts, which effectively narrowed the data range while preserving the underlying distribution patterns. In our visualizations, offenses are delineated along the y-axis, against the log-scaled case counts on the x-axis. We organized the offenses in order of decreasing median case count to highlight the most prevalent factors. Aside from the category ‘all other offenses,’ which appears as a primary cause for both juveniles and adults, the data indicates that juveniles are most frequently apprehended for larceny, whereas adults are more often detained for drug abuse violations. Moreover, “Manslaughter by Negligence” emerged as the least common grounds for arrests in both demographics. Distinctly, “Curfew and Loitering Law Violations” stand out as a significant cause only for juveniles, while “Driving Under the Influence” is a unique concern for adults.\n\n\n3.3.2 Offense Types by Year and Gender\n\n\nCode\njuvenile_heatmap &lt;- juvenile_copy_raw %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(total_male, total_female), \n    names_to = \"gender\", \n    values_to = \"count\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n mutate(\n    gender = recode(gender, \"total_male\" = \"Male\", \"total_female\" = \"Female\"))\n\nggplot(juvenile_heatmap, aes(x = year, y = offense_name, fill = count)) +\n  geom_tile() +  \n  scale_fill_distiller(type = \"seq\", palette = \"Oranges\", direction = 1,) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1995, 2015, by = 5)) +\n  facet_wrap(~gender, ncol = 1, scales = \"free\") + \n  labs(title = \"Type of Offense by Year Heatmap (Juvenile)\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Type of Offense\") +\n  theme_grey(5) \n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nadults_heatmap &lt;- adults_copy_raw %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(total_male, total_female), \n    names_to = \"gender\", \n    values_to = \"count\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n mutate(\n    gender = recode(gender, \"total_male\" = \"Male\", \"total_female\" = \"Female\"))\n\nggplot(adults_heatmap, aes(x = year, y = offense_name, fill = count)) +\n  geom_tile() +  \n  scale_fill_distiller(type = \"seq\", palette = \"Reds\", direction = 1,) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1995, 2015, by = 5)) +\n  facet_wrap(~gender, ncol = 1, scales = \"free\") + \n  labs(title = \"Type of Offense by Year Heatmap (Adults)\",\n       x = \"Year\", y = \"Type of Offense\") +\n  theme_grey(5) \n\n\n\n\n\nThe first heatmap illustrates the frequency of various offenses committed by juveniles, faceted by gender over several years. Darker shades represent higher frequencies. Among female juveniles, common offenses include runaway, simple assault, and larceny. In contrast, male juveniles frequently engage in simple assault, vandalism, larceny, drug abuse violations, burglary, disorderly conduct, and curfew and loitering law violations. Overall, offenses are more frequent and varied among males than females. Notably, the frequency of these crimes has generally decreased over time.\nThe second heatmap focuses on adult offenses, showing a different pattern. One thing to mention is that we employ the “Oranges” color palette for juveniles and “Reds” palette for adults. It intentional to visually emphasize the significantly higher counts of each offense among adults, as indicated in the legend. For female adults, frequent offenses include simple assault and larceny. Male adults often commit simple assault, larceny, drunkenness, drive under the influence, and disorder conduct. Unlike juvenile offenses, there is less variation in adult offenses over time. It’s interesting to point out that offenses like drunkenness and drive under the influence, which are negligible among male juveniles, become significantly more prevalent in adulthood, likely due to the legal age for alcohol consumption and driving."

The data reveals a consistent decrease in arrest numbers across these years for all age categories. The line representing adults, shown in red, demonstrates a steady decrease from its highest point in 1994, declining towards 2016. This trend may reflect shifts in some possible reasons, like law enforcement strategies, policy changes, or a genuine drop in criminal behavior. In contrast, the juvenile arrests, depicted by the blue line, also show a continual decline, but with significantly lower figure compared to adult arrests.\n\n\n3.4.2 Arrest over Time by Year and Age\n\n\nCode\nggplot(long_df_juvenile, aes(x = factor(year), y = count, fill = age)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"RdYlBu\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + \n    labs(title = \"Stacked Bar Plot of Arrest Counts by Juvenile Age Group\",\n         x = \"Year\",\n         y = \"Count\",\n         fill = \"Age\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(long_df_adult, aes(x = factor(year), y = count, fill = age)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n    scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"RdYlBu\") +\n    theme_minimal() +\n    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n    labs(title = \"Stacked Bar Plot of Arrest Counts by Adult Age Group\",\n         x = \"Year\",\n         y = \"Count\",\n         fill = \"Age\")\n\n\n\n\n\nTo breakdown the above trend by age group, we created a stacked bar chart displaying data from 1994 to 2016. The x-axis marks the years, while the y-axis quantifies the offense counts. Each bar denotes a specific year, with various color-coded segments representing the different juvenile age groups. These segments transition from dark blue to red, signifying age groups ranging from 0-9 to 17 years, as detailed in the chart’s legend.\nFor the juvenile population, the total number of arrests shows a declining trend, with individual age subgroups also demonstrating varying degrees of decrease. In contrast, the adult population exhibits a less pronounced downward trend, with certain age subgroups, particularly those aged 65 and over, experiencing a slight increase in arrests.\nApart from the very young age group of 0-9 years in the juvenile category, the differences among the remaining age groups are relatively minor. Similarly, among adults, aside from the 65-plus demographic, the variations between age groups do not show marked significance.\n\n\n3.4.3 Interactive Coordinates Plot for Arrest by Offense Type, Gender, Age, and Year\n\n\nCode\njuvenile_parallel &lt;- juvenile_copy_raw %&gt;%\n  select(offense_name, year, starts_with(\"age_\")) %&gt;%\n  rename_with(~ {\n    .x &lt;- sub(\"age_\", \"\", .x)  \n    sub(\"_(.)$\", \"\\\\1\", .x)  \n  }, starts_with(\"age_\"))\n  \nlibrary(parcoords)\njuvenile_parallel  |&gt;\n  parcoords(\n    rownames = F \n    , brushMode = \"1D-axes\"\n    , reorderable = T\n    , queue = T    \n    , alpha = .3\n    )  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive parallel coordinates plot connects multiple variables such as offense type, year, and age groups for both genders among juveniles. We decide to focus solely on juvenile data for the two reasons: 1). even after subsetting and preprocessing, adult data still has too many variables, resulting in a cluttered and less informative graph. 2). Understanding patterns in juvenile crime is vital for early intervention and prevention. By addressing juvenile delinquency, we could potentially reduce future crime rates, as today’s juveniles are tomorrow’s adults.\nYou can interact with the plot by dragging lines along the axes to filter regions. The analysis reveals several notable trends. Larceny emerges as a predominant offense among juveniles, with high frequencies across all age groups around 1995. In contrast, offenses like rape, stolen property, and motor vehicle theft show lower arrest rates. This pattern may be attributed to juveniles’ vulnerability to peer pressure, leading them to commit theft for group acceptance or due to dares. Economic needs or mere curiosity also play a role in their involvement in crimes. Furthermore, most juveniles are unlikely to engage in more severe crimes like rape, possibly due to a lack of inclination."

The map assigns a color to each state that corresponds to its total incident count, with a legend to the right translating the intensity of the color to the number of incidents. According to the visualization, states such as California and one in the Northeast—presumably New York—are marked in black or dark purple, signaling a larger number of recorded incidents, with New York reporting 935 incidents and California registering 2,088, potentially the highest in the dataset. On the other hand, lighter hues such as pale yellow denote lower incident counts, exemplified by regions like Guam and Arkansas.\n\n\n3.5.2 Location with the Highest Hate Crime Incidents\n\n\nCode\nlocation_counts &lt;- hate_crime22 %&gt;%\n  count(location_name) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\ntop_25_location &lt;- ceiling(nrow(location_counts) * 0.25)\ntop_locations &lt;- head(location_counts, top_25_location)\n\nggplot(top_locations, aes(x = n, y = reorder(location_name, n))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Number of Incidents\", y = \"Location\", title = \"Top 25% Location with Hate Crime Incidents\") +\n  theme_grey(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Offender Race with the Highest Hate Crime Incidents\n\n\nCode\nrace_counts &lt;- hate_crime22 %&gt;%\n  count(offender_race) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\nggplot(race_counts, aes(x = n, y = reorder(offender_race, n))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Number of Incidents\", y = \"Offender Race\", title = \"Offender Race with Hate Crime Incidents\") +\n  theme_grey(10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Bias Tpye with the Highest Hate Crime Incidents\n\n\nCode\nbias_counts &lt;- hate_crime22 %&gt;%\n  count(bias_desc) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\ntop_10_bias &lt;- ceiling(nrow(bias_counts) * 0.1)\ntop_bias &lt;- head(bias_counts, top_10_bias)\n\nggplot(top_bias, aes(x = n, y = reorder(bias_desc, n))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Number of Incidents\", y = \"Bias Description\", title = \"Top 10% Bias Description with Hate Crime Incidents\") +\n  theme_grey(9)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe three separate Cleveland dot plots, with the number of incidents on the x-axis, address the question, “What are the top locations, offender races, and bias types in hate crimes for 2022?”\nThe most common locations for hate crimes are residences or homes, followed by highways, roads, alleys, streets, sidewalks, and schools. The high incidence of crimes in residences or homes might be related to a high rate of larceny. Installing surveillance cameras at homes could mitigate potential losses. The significant number of incidents in schools also demands attention, emphasizing the need to strengthen management and safety measures in and around school environments.\nThe offender race graph indicates that the predominant racial group among hate crime offenders is White, followed by Black or African American, despite not specified and unknown.\nThe bias type graph reveals that the leading types of bias in hate crimes are Anti-Black or African American, Anti-Jewish, Anti-Gay (Male), and Anti-White. This data correlates with the findings in the offender race graph, suggesting a relationship between the offender’s race and the type of bias motivating the crime."
